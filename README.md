# Copernicus
Geographic Information System using Sentinel Data and SNAP or QGIS software,

## Training

Running from 2017 to December 2021, the Copernicus Research and User Support (RUS) service aimed to develop an online free-access platform to promote the uptake of Copernicus data and support the scaling up of educational and R&D activities.

The service was funded by the European Commission, managed by the European Space Agency and operated by CSSI and its partners.

The training sessions of the Copernicus RUS service are available [here](https://eo4society.esa.int/resources/copernicus-rus-training-materials/). In this repo I will be going through each of the training sessions, and try to reproduce all the work. Additionally, I will work on projects based on these trainings.
